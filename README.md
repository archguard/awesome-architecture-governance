# Awesome architecture governance


## Rule-based

Cross-languages:

- [ArchUnit](https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnitNET)  is a Java architecture test library, to specify and assert architecture rules in plain Java.
- [Spectral](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral) a flexible JSON/YAML linter for creating automated style guides, with baked in support for OpenAPI v3.1, v3.0, and v2.0. 
- [SQLFluff](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff) is a dialect-flexible and configurable SQL linter. Designed with ELT applications in mind, SQLFluff also works with Jinja templating and dbt. SQLFluff will auto-fix most linting errors, allowing you to focus your time on what matters.

## Analysis 

### Library

- [CodeQuery](https://github.com/ruben2020/codequery) A code-understanding, code-browsing or code-search tool. This is a tool to index, then query or search C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, Go and Javascript source code. It builds upon the databases of cscope and ctags, and provides a nice GUI tool. 
- [Ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags) generates an index (or tag) file of language objects found in source files for programming languages. This index makes it easy for text editors and other tools to locate the indexed items.
- [Doxygen](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen)  is the de facto standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources, but it also supports other popular programming languages such as C, Objective-C, C#, PHP, Java, Python, IDL (Corba, Microsoft, and UNO/OpenOffice flavors), Fortran, and to some extent D. Doxygen also supports the hardware description language VHDL.
- [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited. 

### Parser Generator

- [ANTLR](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) is a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks.

### Platform

- [Sonarqube](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube) is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continuous inspection of code quality to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs, code smells on 17 programming languages.

### Android

- [Smali](https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali)  is an assembler/disassembler for the dex format used by dalvik, Android's Java VM implementation. The syntax is loosely based on Jasmin's/dedexer's syntax, and supports the full functionality of the dex format (annotations, debug info, line info, etc.)

## Paid 

### Platform

- [Architecture Repository](https://www.dragon1.com/applications/architecture-repository) The Architecture Repository is a software tool that stores the important architectural input and output, including Architectures themselves, the elements of which they are composed, standards, references, principles and the Governance Register.
